Cat's Dream

How neatly a cat sleeps,
sleeps with its paws and its posture,
sleeps with its wicked claws,
and with its unfeeling blood,
sleeps with all the rings—
a series of burnt circles—
which have formed the odd geology
of its sand-colored tail.

I should like to sleep like a cat,
with all the fur of time,
with <span class = "hair">a tongu</span>e rough as flint,
with the dry sex of fire;
and after speaking to no one,
stretch myself over the world,
over roofs and landscapes,
with a passionate desire
to hunt the rats in my dreams.
I have seen how the cat asleep
would <span class = "hair">undulate, how the n</span>ight
flowed through it like dark water;
and at times, it was going to fall
or possibly plunge into
the bare deserted snowdrifts.
Sometimes it grew so much in sleep
like a tiger's great-grandfather,
and would leap <span class = "hair">in the darkness over
roof</span>tops, clouds and volcanoes.
Sleep, sleep cat of the night,
with episcopal ceremony
and your stone-carved moustache.
Take care of all our dreams;
control the obscurity
of our slumbering prowess
with your re<span class = "hair">lentless heart
and the great r</span>uff of your tail.

If you forgot me

I want you to know
one thing.

You know how this is:
if I look
at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window,
if I touch
near the fire
the impalpab<span class = "hair">le ash
or the wrinkle</span><span class = "face">d</span> <span class = "hair">body of th</span>e log,
everything carries me to you,
as if everything that exists,
aromas, light, metals,
were little boats
that sail
toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

Well, now,
if little by little you stop loving me
<span class = "hair">I shall stop loving y</span><span class = "face">ou li</span><span class = "hair">ttle by littl</span>e.

If suddenly
you forget me
do not look for me,
for I shall already have forgotten you.

If you think it long and mad,
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
and you decide
to leave me at th<span class = "hair">e shore
of the h</span><span class = "face">e</span><span class = "hair">art</span> <span class = "face">wher</span><span class = "hair">e I have ro</span>ots,
remember
that on that day,
at t<span class="big">Hi,</span>s hour, 
<!-- HI -->
I shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land.

But
if each day,
each hour,
you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable swee<span class = "hair">tness,
if each da</span><span class = "face">y </span><span class = "hair">a</span> <span class = "face">flower</span>
<span class = "hair">climbs up t</span>o your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as long as you live it will be in your <span class = "hair">arms
without le</span><span class = "face">avin</span><span class = "hair">g</span><span class = "face"> mine.

L</span><span class = "hair">ove, We're</span> Going Home Now

Love, we're going home now,
Where the vines clamber over the trellis:
Even before you, the summer will arrive,
On its honeysuckle feet, in your bedroom.

Our nomadic kisse<span class = "hair">s wandered ov</span><span class = "face">er al</span><span class = "hair">l</span> <span class = "face">the worl</span><span class = "hair">d:
Armenia,</span> dollop of disinterred honey:
Ceylon, green dove: and the YangTse with its old
Old patience, dividing the day from the night.

And now, dearest, we return, across the crackling sea
Like two blind bird<span class = "hair">s to their wall,</span>
<span class = "face">To t</span><span class = "hair">h</span><span class = "face">eir nest in</span> <span class = "hair">a distant</span> spring:

Because love cannot always fly without resting,
Our lives return to the wall, to the rocks of the sea:
Our kisses head back home where they belong.

Here I Love You

Here I love you.
In the d<span class = "hair">ark pines the</span> <span class = "face">wind disentangles</span> <span class = "hair">itself.
The</span> moon glows like phosphorous on the vagrant waters.
Days, all one kind, go chasing each other.

The snow unfurls in dancing figures.
A silver gull slips down from the west.
Sometimes a sail. High<span class = "hair">, high stars.
</span>Oh t<span class = "face">he black cross o</span><span class = "hair">f a ship.</span>
Alone.


Sometimes I get up early and even my soul is wet.
Far away the sea sounds and resounds.
This is a port.

Here I love you.
Here I love you and the horizon hides you in vain.
I love you still <span class = "hair">among thes</span><span class = "face">e</span> cold th<span class = "face">ings.
Som</span>etim<span class = "hair">es my k</span>isses go on those heavy vessels
that cross the sea towards no arrival.
I see myself forgotten like those old anchors.

The piers sadden when the afternoon moors there.
My life grows tired, hungry t<span class = "hair">o no purpos</span><span class = "face">e.
I love what I do</span> not h<span class = "hair">ave. Yo</span>u are so far.
My loathing wrestles with the slow twilights.
But night comes and starts to sing to me.

The moon turns its clockwork dream.
The biggest stars look at me with your eyes.
And as I lov<span class = "hair">e you, the</span> <span class = "face">pines in the wind
want t</span><span class = "hair">o sing yo</span>ur name with their leaves of wire.

Bird

It was passed from one bird to another,
the whole gift of the day.
The day went from flute to flute,
went dressed in vegetation,
in flights which opened <span class = "hair">a tunnel
th</span><span class = "face">rough the wind would pas</span><span class = "hair">s
to wh</span>ere birds were breaking open
the dense blue air -
and there, night came in.

When I returned from so many journeys,
I stayed suspended and green
between sun and geography -
I saw how win<span class = "hair">gs worked</span>,
</span><span class = "face">how perfumes are transmi</span><span class = "hair">tted
by</span> feathery telegraph,
and from above I saw the path,
the springs and the roof tiles,
the fishermen at their trades,
the trousers of the foam;
I saw it all from my green sky.
I had no more alphabe<span class = "hair">t
than the</span> <span class = "face">swallows in their courses,</span>
<span class = "hair">the tiny</span>, shining water
of the small bird on fire
which dances out of the pollen.

Absence

I have scarcely left you
When you go in me, crystalline,
Or trembling,
Or uneasy, wounded by me
Or overwhel<span class = "hair">med with l</span><span class = "face">ove, as
when your eyes
Clo</span><span class = "hair">se upon</span> the gift of life
That without cease I give you.

My love,
We have found each other
Thirsty and we have
Drunk up all the water and the
Blood,
We found each other
Hungry
And we bit each othe<span class = "hair">r
As fire b</span><span class = "face">ites,
Leaving wounds in us</span><span class = "hair">.

But wait</span> for me,
Keep for me your sweetness.
I will give you too
A rose.

I Remember You As You Were

I remember you as you were in the last autumn.
You were the grey beret and the still hear<span class = "hair">t.
In your e</span><span class = "face">yes the fl</span>ames of t<span class = "face">he twili</span><span class = "hair">ght fough</span>t on.
And the leaves fell in the water of your soul.

Clasping my arms like a climbing plant
the leaves garnered your voice, that was slow and at peace.
Bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burn<span class = "hair">ing.
Sweet</span> b<span class = "face">lue hyacint</span>h twi<span class = "face"> sted ov</span><span class = "hair">er my soul</span>.

I feel your eyes traveling, and the autumn is far off:
Grey beret, voice of a bird, heart like a house
Towards which my deep longings migrated
And my kisses fell, happy as embers.

Sky from a s<span class = "hair">hip. Field fr</span>om <span class = "face">the hills:
Your me</span><span class = "hair">mory is made</span> of light, of smoke, of a still pond!
Beyond your eyes, farther on, the evenings were blazing.
Dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul.

Leaning Into The Afternoons

Leaning into the afternoons <span class = "hair">I cast my sa</span>d nets
<span class = "face">towards your</span> <span class = "hair">oceanic eyes.

T</span>here in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames,
its arms turning like a drowning man's.

I send out red signals across your absent eyes
that smell like the sea or the beach by a li<span class = "hair">ghthouse.

You</span> keep <span class = "face">only darkn</span>ess, <span class = "hair">my distant fe</span>male,
from your regard sometimes the coast of dread emerges.

Leaning into the afternoons I fling my sad nets
to that sea that is thrashed by your oceanic eyes.

The birds of night peck at <span class = "hair">he first stars
t</span>hat fl<span class = "face">ash like my</span> soul <span class = "hair">when I love you</span>.

The night gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land.

Enigma with Flower

Victory. It has come late, I had not learnt
how to arrive, like the lily, at will,
the white <span class = "hair">figure, that pierces</span>
the <span class = "face">motionless</span> etern<span class = "hair">ity of earth,
p</span><span class = "face">ushing at</span> clear, faint, form,
till the hour strikes: that clay,
with a white ray, or a spur of milk.
Shedding of clothing, the thick darkness of soil,
on whose cliff the fair flower advances,
ti<span class = "face">ll the fl</span><span class = "hair">ag of its white</span>n <span class = "face">ess
defeat</span>s the co<span class = "hair">ntemptible dee</span><span class = "face">p of night,</span>
and, from the motion of light,
spills itself in astonished seed.

I Do Not Love You Except Because I Love You

I do not love you except because I love you;
I go from lov<span class = "face">ing to </span><span class = "hair">not loving you,
F</span>r<span class = "face">o</span>m waiting to not <span class = "hair">waiting for you</span>
<span class = "face">My heart mo</span>ves from cold to fire.

I love you only because it's you the one I love;
I hate you deeply, and hating you
Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
I<span class = "face">s that I do </span><span class = "hair">not see you</span> but love you blindly.

<span class = "hair">Maybe January li</span><span class = "face">ght will con</span>sume
My heart with its cruel
Ray, stealing my key to true calm.

In this part of the story I am the one who
Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love yo<span class = "face">u,
Because</span> <span class = "hair">I love you, L</span>ove, in fire and blo<span class = "hair">od.

Your Laughter

Take</span><span class = "face"> bread </span>away from me, if you wish,
take air away, but
do not take from me your laughter.

Do not take away the rose,
the lance flower that you pluck,
the water that suddenl<span class = "face">y
bursts for</span><span class = "hair">th in joy,
t</span>he sudden wave
of <span class = "hair">silver born in you. My</span>

<span class = "face"> struggle is</span> harsh and I come back
with eyes tired
at times from having seen
the unchanging earth,
but when your laughter enters
it rises to the sky seeking me
and it opens fo<span class = "face">r me all
the do</span><span class = "hair">ors of li</span>fe.

My love, in the <span class = "hair">darkest
hour your</span><span class = "face"> laughter
opens</span>, and if suddenly
you see my blood staining
the stones of the street,
laugh, because your laughter
will be for my hands
like a fresh sword.

Next to the sea in the au<span class = "face">tumn,
your lau</span><span class = "hair">ghter mu</span>st raise
its foamy <span class = "hair">cascade,
and in</span><span class = "face"> the spring, love,</span>
I want your laughter like
the flower I was waiting for,
the blue flower, the rose
of my echoing country.

Laugh at the night,
at the day, at the moon,
laugh at the tw<span class = "face">isted
streets o</span><span class = "hair">f the isl</span>and,
laugh at this cl<span class = "hair">umsy
boy who l</span>ov<span class = "face">es you,
but whe</span>n I open
my eyes and close them,
when my steps go,
when my steps return,
deny me bread, air,
light, spring,
but never your laughter
for I would die.

A Dog Has D<span class = "face">ied

My dog ha</span><span class = "hair">s died.
I</span> buried him in the ga<span class = "hair">rden
next to</span> a ru<span class = "face">sted old machi</span>ne.

Some day I'll join him right there,
but now he's gone with his shaggy coat,
his bad manners and his cold nose,
and I, the materialist, who never believed
in any <span class = "face">promised heav</span><span class = "hair">en in t</span>he sky
for any human <span class = "hair">being,
I bel</span>ieve <span class = "face">in a heaven I'll n</span>ever enter.
Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom
where my dog waits for my arrival
waving his fan-like tail in friendship.

Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on e<span class = "face">arth,
of having </span><span class = "hair">lost a c</span>ompanion
who was n<span class = "hair">ever serv</span>ile.
Hi<span class = "face">s friendship for m</span>e, like that of a porcupine
withholding its authority,
was the friendship of a star, aloof,
with no more intimacy than was called for,
with no exaggerations:
he <span class = "face">never climbed a</span><span class = "hair">ll over</span> my clothes
filling me <span class = "hair">full of hi</span>s hair o<span class = "face">r his mange,
he</span> never rubbed up against my knee
like other dogs obsessed with sex.

No, my dog used to gaze at me,
paying me the attention I need,
the attention required
to make <span class = "face">a vain person </span><span class = "hair">like me</span>l understand
that, bei<span class = "hair">ng a do</span>g, he wa<span class = "face">s wasting time,</span>
but, with those eyes so much purer than mine,
he'd keep on gazing at me
with a look that reserved for me alone
all his sweet and shaggy life,
always near me, nev<span class = "face">er troubling me,</span>
<span class = "hair">and</span> asking nothing.

Ai, how <span class = "hair">many</span> times ha<span class = "face">ve I envied his ta</span>il
as we walked together on the shores of the sea
in the lonely winter of Isla Negra
where the wintering birds filled the sky
and my hairy dog was jumping about
<span class = "face">full of the voltag</span>e of the sea's movement:
my wandering do<span class = "face">g, sniffing away</span>
with his golden tail held high,
face to face with the ocean's spray.

Joyful, joyful, joyful,
as only dogs know how to be happy
with only the autonomy
of their shame<span class = "face">ess spirit.

There</span>l are no good-byes for my dog who has di<span class = "face">ed,
and we don'</span>t now and never did lie to each other.

So now he's gone and I buried him,
and that's all there is to it.

'M Explaining A Few Things

You are going to ask: and whe<span class = "face">re are the lilacs?</span>
and the poppy-petalled metaphysics?
an<span class = "face">d the rain repeat</span>edly spattering
its words and drilling them full
of apertures and birds?
I'll tell you all the news.

I lived in a suburb,
a suburb of Madrid, with bells,
and clocks, and tre<span class = "face">es.

From there y</span>ou could look out
over Castille's dry face:
<span class = "face">a leather ocean.</span>
My house was called
the house of flowers, because in every cranny
geraniums burst: it was
a good-looking house
with its dogs and children.
Remember, Raul?
E<span class = "face">h, Rafel? Federic</span>o, do you remember
from under the groun<span class = "face">d
my balconies</span> on which
the light of June drowned flowers in your mouth?
Brother, my brother!
Everything
loud with big voices, the salt of merchandises,
pile-ups of palpitating b<span class = "face">read,
the stalls o</span>f my suburb of Arguelles with its statue
l<span class = "face">ike a drained ink</span>well in a swirl of hake:
oil flowed into spoons,
a deep baying
of feet and hands swelled in the streets,
metres, litres, the sharp
measure of life,
stacked-up fish,
<span class = "face">the texture of ro</span>ofs with a cold sun in which
the weather <span class = "face">vane falters,
the</span> fine, frenzied ivory of potatoes,
wave on wave of tomatoes rolling down the sea.

And one morning all that was burning,
one morning the bonfires
leapt out of the ea<span class = "face">rth
devouring hu</span>man beings --
and from then on fire,
gu<span class = "face">npowder from th</span>en on,
and from then on blood.
Bandits with planes and Moors,
bandits with finger-rings and duchesses,
bandits with black friars spattering blessings
came through <span class = "face">the sky to kill</span> children
and the blood of children ran thro<span class = "face">ugh the streets</span>
without fuss, like children's blood.

Jackals that the jackals would despise,
stones that the dry thistle would bite on and spit out,
vipers that the vipers would abomin<span class = "face">ate!

Face to fa</span>ce with you I have seen the blood
of Spain <span class = "face">tower like a ti</span>de
to drown you in one wave
of pride and knives!

Treacherous
generals:
see my dead house,
look at broken Spain :
from every house burning metal flows
instead <span class = "face">of flowers,
from every socket of Spain
Spain emerges
and from every</span> dead child a rifle with eyes,
and from every crime bullets are born
which will one day find
the bull's eye of your hearts.

And you'll ask: why doesn't his poetry
s<span class = "face">peak of dreams and leaves
and the great volcanoes of his native land?

Com</span>e and see the blood in the streets.
Come and see
The blood in the streets.
Come and see the blood
In the streets!
